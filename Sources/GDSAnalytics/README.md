# GDS Analytics

A set of models that mirror the GDS Digital Identity Analytics Implementation Guide for Google Analytics. 

All data gathered via the Firebase SDK stream into the wider GDS Google Analytics account, therefore it is vital that all tracking aligns with the wider organisations approach and guidance.
These models ensure that all analytics submitted from the app are formed-correctly.

This package does not submit events, it is only for structuring the output accordingly.
We recommend using the Analytics package alongside our [Logging package](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/mobile-ios-logging) to submit the events to Firebase Analytics.

## Screen Tracking

### Standard Screens

Use the `ScreenView` type to represent screens that a user navigates through in the app.

This type is generic and can be used to represent any type which has a name.
We generally use enums to give type-safety to our screen tagging:

```swift
enum MyAppScreens: String {
    case home = "HOME"
    case settings = "SETTINGS"
}

extension MyAppScreen: NamedScreen {
    var name: String {
        rawValue
    }
}
```

In this case, we would be able to generate the correct parameters for our screen:

```swift
let screenView = ScreenView(screen: MyAppScreens.home, 
                            titleKey: "Welcome to GOV.UK One Login")
```

> Here the `titleKey` is an `NSLocalizedString` key. Passing in the key ensures that parameter values are always returned in English regardless of the device setting. If the string contains variable arguments (e.g. %@, %d), these can also be included with the `variableKeys` initialiser parameter: 
>
> ```swift
> ScreenView(screen: MyAppScreens.home, 
>            titleKey: "Welcome to %@", 
>            variableKeys: ["GOV.UK One Login"])
> ```
>
> You can pass in a localised string directly into this parameter to ensure that localised parameter values are used.

#### Expected Parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Expected Format | Example |
| ------------- |-------------| ----- | ---- |
| screenName | Unique name for each app screen, irrespective of screenClass used to identify pathways in the user journey. | SNAKE_CASE. Maximum of 40 characters. | `FRONT_INSTRUCTION` |
| title | The frontend display title | lowercase | Lowercase and no longer than 100 characters | `how to take a photo of your photo id` |

### Error Screens

Use the `ErrorScreenView` to represent error screens.

This is an extension of the `ScreenViewProtocol`, meaning it contains the same functionality as `ScreenView`, but allows you to pass in additional information about the error that has occured.
This helps the analytics team to distinguish between the multiple types of error that may occur throughout the app.

Either include each of the error parameters separately:

```swift
let screenView = ErrorScreenView(
    screen: ErrorScreen.generic,
    titleKey: "Something went wrong",
    endpoint: "appInfo",
    statusCode: "401",
    hash: "83766358f64858b51afb745bbdde91bb"
)
```

Or pass in an error that conforms to the `LoggableError` protocol:

```swift
extension URLError: LoggableError {
    public var endpoint: String? {
        failingURL?.pathComponents.last
    }
    
    public var statucCode: String? {
        errorCode.description
    }
}

let screenView = ErrorScreenView(
    screen: ErrorScreen.generic,
    titleKey: "Something went wrong",
    error: urlError
)
```

#### Expected Parameters:

`screenName` and `title` as per standard screens, above.

| Parameter | Description | Expected Format | Example |
| ------------- |-------------| ----- | --- |
| endpoint | The API or SDK endpoint being called by the application which caused the error. | Optional. Lowercase. | `appinfo` |
| reason | The reason the error was thrown: i.e. if the user has no internet connection, or an error was thrown by the API. | Optional. Lowercase. | `network` |
| status | The HTTP status code that was thrown by the remote service. | Optional. Lowercase. | `401` |
| hash | A unique error code / hash for the error. Usually an MD5 hash of the endpoint and status code. | Optional. Lowercase. | `83766358f64858b51afb745bbdde91bb` |

Example:
